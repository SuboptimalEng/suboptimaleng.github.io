### Backstory
Inspired by [@shl](https://www.twitter.com/shl)'s openness about [Gumroad](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1093532795438133253?s=20),
I decided to __add transparency to my journey of getting to 100K subs on YouTube__.
Every month, I'll post my statsÂ¹ along with some key learnings I made on the way.
You can follow the short-form updates on my twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/suboptimaleng).

### The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?

|          | Views      |  Total Subs  | Earnings  |
| -------- | ---------- |  ----------- | --------- |
| __Jan.__ | 17k        |  5200        | $60       |
| __Feb.__ | 12k        |  5390        | $40       |
| __Mar.__ | 9k         |  5500        | $30       |
| __Apr.__ | -          |  -           | -         |

### March
I'm finally facing the aftermath of unlisting all of my LeetCode videos. I suspect that __YouTube stopped recommending my content__
because it previously associated my channel with "LeetCode" and "Python" but all of those videos are now unlisted.

__Views, earnings, and subscriber growth took a huge hit__.
In January, ~400 people subscribed to my channel without me posting a single video for over 60 days --
but now, even with a consistent upload schedule, I only got 100 subscribers.
__I'm not complaining though__; I knew what I signed up for by removing so much content last month.

On the bright side __I finally moved out of my parents house__.
I was leeching off of them during the transition period between my tech job and YouTube,
but it was high time I live on my own dime. Moving out was the right choice --
__I was way too distracted with my old video games__ (Halo MCC, Modern Warfare, and Mario Kart Wii).

Regardless, __moving sucked__ -- ESPECIALLY the monetary costs associated with it --
__but I doubled my productivity__. Though I now had to do more household chores and figure out what to eat every day,
I still found enough free time to start making 2 videos per week. This is a HUGE win.

### February
__I unlisted my LeetCode videos__ because I didn't want people think I still made interview prep content.
My total views dropped from 160k to 40k after I made this change.
I basically destroyed my channel __in the hopes of "re-branding" it__.

### January
I didn't post any YouTube videos from Nov 10th - Jan 13th and I still earned $50 of passive income in Dec. 2020!
Now, I'm __back on track with my old uploading schedule of 1 video per week__.
