### Backstory
Inspired by [@shl](https://www.twitter.com/shl), I decided to __add transparency to my journey of getting to 100K subs on YouTube__.
Every month, I'll post my statsÂ¹ along with some key learnings I made on the way.
You can follow the short-form updates on my twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/suboptimaleng).

### The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?
