### Backstory
Inspired by [@shl](https://www.twitter.com/shl)'s openness about [Gumroad](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1093532795438133253?s=20),
I decided to __add transparency to my journey of getting to 100K subs on YouTube__.
Every month, I'll post my statsÂ¹ along with some key learnings I made on the way.
You can follow the short-form updates on my twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/suboptimaleng).

### The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?

|          | Views      |  Total Subs  | Earnings  |
| -------- | ---------- |  ----------- | --------- |
| __Mar.__ | 9k (-3k)   |  5500 (+110) | $30 (-10) |
| __Feb.__ | 12k (-5k)  |  5390 (+190) | $40 (-20) |
| __Jan.__ | 17k (+5k)  |  5200 (+360) | $60 (+10) |

### March Update

### February Update
I unlisted my LeetCode videos (all of which were high performing)
because I didn't want people think I still made coding interview prep content.
This is one of those "difficult decisions" which I hope will pay off in the future.

My total views dropped from 160k to 40k after I made change so
I basically destroyed my channel in the hopes of "re-branding" it.
Only time can tell how devestating this move will be.


### January Update
I didn't post any YouTube videos from Nov 10th - Jan 13th so I earned ~50$ of passive income in Dec. 2020!
Now, I'm back on track with my old uploading schedule of posting 1 vid/week.

### Footnotes
- [1]: I fudge earnings by 5-10%.
