### Disclaimer
If the title of this post didn't convince you, then this disclaimer certainly should.
__This blog is a meme__ - please don't take it seriously.

### A short bio
My name is Suboptimal¹, and I'm just a typical Indian software engineer.
In late 2020 -- against everyone's *"best wishes"* -- __I quit my 6-figure tech job
to pursue [YouTube](https://youtube.com/SuboptimalEng) full-time__.
I keep track of my thoughts and learnings on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) & this blog.

### Why bother with a blog?
I wanted to keep written snapshots of my journey as a YouTuber __mostly for myself__, and __partially as a proof of work__.

I truly believe that __the next wave of tech founders will start with a social media presence__.
I could be right; I'll probably be wrong -- regardless, I'm *putting my money where my mouth is²*,
and I plan to see it through to the bitter end (A.K.A. when my savings runs out).

### What's in it for you?
I consider myself to be an *indie hacker* + *content creator*, and, as such,
I'll be writing __posts about my life as a solo-founder³ and YouTuber__.
Here's a small taste of what you can expect:
- Monthly updates of my YouTube stats (short form versions [posted on twitter](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng/status/1362817842547216384?s=20))
- The financial ups and downs of running a small YouTube channel
- Why I left the tech industry to become a YouTuber

### Footnotes
- [1]: Not my real name, though I really wish it was.
- [2]: The opportunity cost of leaving tech: ~200k/year.
- [3]: I have not made any products as of Apr. 15th, 2021.
