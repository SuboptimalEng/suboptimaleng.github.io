### Disclaimer
If the title of this blog post didn't convince you, then this disclaimer certainly should.
__This blog is a meme__ - please don't take it seriously.

### A short bio (for those that don't know)
My name is Suboptimal¹, and I'm just a typical Indian software engineer.
In late 2020 -- against everyone's² *"best wishes"* -- I __quit my 6-figure tech job__ to pursue [YouTube](https://youtube.com/SuboptimalEng) full-time.
I keep track of my thoughts and learnings on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) & this blog.

### Why bother with a blog?
I am keeping written snapshots of my journey as a YouTuber mostly for myself, and partially as a proof of work.

### What's in it for you?
