### Backstory
Inspired by [@shl](https://www.twitter.com/shl)'s openness about [Gumroad](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1093532795438133253?s=20),
I decided to __add transparency to my journey of getting to 100K subs on YouTube__.
Every month, I'll post my statsÂ¹ and some key learnings I made along on the way.
You can follow the short-form updates on my twitter [@SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/suboptimaleng).

### The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?

|          | Views      |  Total Subs  | Earnings  |
| -------- | ---------- |  ----------- | --------- |
| __Jan.__ | 17k        |  5200 (+350) | $60       |
| __Feb.__ | 12k        |  5390 (+190) | $40       |
| __Mar.__ | 9k         |  5500 (+110) | $30       |
| __Apr.__ | 10k        |  5650 (+150) | $30       |
| __May__  | -          |  -           | -         |

### April
__I focused heavily on my niche of making educational content about Vue.js and Tailwind CSS__.
I uploaded ~2 videos/week -- either about some core UI concept, or about a clone built with Vue.js and Tailwind.
It didn't happen immediately, but __more and more people started discovering my Tailwind content through YouTube__!
By the end of the month, one of the top 10 search words that recommended my videos was _tailwind css_.

Although April was a slow month (in terms of numbers),
it felt good to put out some content after finally getting settled into my new place.
In the next few months, __I plan to release more videos about Vue, Tailwind, VS Code, and Vim__.
I want the YouTube algorithm to recommend my channel _whenever_ these key words come up.

Oh, and I started a [24/7 Classical Music Live Stream on YouTube with DigitalOcean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxmbLL60KA).

### March
I'm finally facing the aftermath of unlisting all of my LeetCode videos. I suspect that __YouTube stopped recommending my content__
because it previously associated my channel with "LeetCode" and "Python" but all of those videos are now unlisted.

__Views, earnings, and subscriber growth took a huge hit__.
In January, ~400 people subscribed to my channel without me posting a single video for over 60 days --
but now, even with a consistent upload schedule, I only got 100 subscribers.
__I'm not complaining though__; I knew what I signed up for by removing so much content last month.

On the bright side __I finally moved out of my parents house__.
I was leeching off of them during the transition period between my tech job and YouTube,
but it was high time I live on my own dime. Moving out was the right choice --
__I was way too distracted with my old video games__ (Halo MCC, Modern Warfare, and Mario Kart Wii).

### February
__I unlisted my LeetCode videos__ because I didn't want people think I still made interview prep content.
My total views dropped from 160k to 40k after I made this change.
I basically destroyed my channel __in the hopes of rebranding it__.

### January
I didn't post any YouTube videos from Nov 10th - Jan 13th and I still earned $50 of passive income in Dec. 2020!
Now, I'm __back on track with my old uploading schedule of 1 video per week__.
